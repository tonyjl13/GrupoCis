							  Please consult the online guide for further information about this function.<br />\
							  Notifications sent by text message and/or e-mail are provided by {1} via the {0} service under the following conditions:<br />\
							  <ul>\
							  	<li>Text messages are sent to the number registered for sending the {0} access code. E-mail messages are sent to the indicated address once after activation with the confirmation code received at said address.</li>\
							  	<li>{1} is not responsible for messages that are not received. Messages may be blocked for technical reasons which are beyond the control of {1} (mobile network coverage, blocking of certain functions by telephone operators, anti-spam filters for e-mail, etc.).</li>\
							    <li>Information messages are not transmitted immediately following the event giving rise to them, but are normally sent with a 30-minute delay. In the case of text messages (SMS), the timing set by the user applies. Maestro card transactions are displayed in the user''s account on the next working day following use of the card. For this reason, messages relating to Maestro cards are also sent on the next working day.</li>\
							    <li>Messages contain information about your bank account and transactions. {1} does not assume any responsibility in connection with the use of messages or the information they contain once they have been sent to the user. Please remember that these messages are sent via unencrypted channels and that e-mail in particular is a channel that can be easily intercepted. {1} does not assume any responsibility in the event that messages are intercepted internationally, manipulated, or if their content is disclosed by third parties that receive them, if they are obtained by means of communication channels being monitored or if third parties have access to the terminal that receives the messages (misappropriation or loss). </li>\
							  	<li>For the above-mentioned reasons, notifications sent by text message or e-mail cannot be considered as legally binding confirmations.</li>\
							  	<li>{1} reserves the right to interrupt the transmission of notifications at any time, either for technical reasons or in the event of suspected irregular use by the user.</li>\
							  	<li>The text message service entails a cost of CHF 0.20 for each text message sent. The first 10 text messages per month are free of charge. The number of free text messages cannot be accumulated over several months. The amount will be debited per half year to the main account for each contract. Text messages for accessing {0} and Transaction Protection are always free of charge. The detailed monthly balance can be viewed at any time under "Events and notifications". The e-mail is free of charge.</li>\
							  	<li>It is possible that telephone operators will charge for the reception of text messages, especially abroad. Please enquire with your telephone operator regarding any charges for this service.</li>\
							  	<li>These provisions are an integral part of the General Terms and Conditions for Electronic Banking Services, signed by the user upon activation of the {0} contract.</li>\
							  </ul>\
							  By activating the service, the user accepts the above-mentioned conditions.
